Spin orbit coupling parameters throughout the periodic table for DFTB 


Here we present the Spin orbit coupling parameters through the perioidic table. The parameters works well in DFTB. We have tested them for different materials such as III-V semiconductors, Topological insulators, and Two dimensional dichalcogenides TMDCs.
